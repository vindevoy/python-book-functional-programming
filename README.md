# Functional programming in Python

## Install

When I was working on my paper for the zythology course I was following, I used sphinx-doc already.  
So it may be that some installation files needed are already installed at that time.  I cannot verify it at the moment.  
I added these packages also at that moment:

````
sudo apt-get install entr

sudo apt-get install latexmk
sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-recommended
sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra
sudo apt-get install texlive-lang-european
````

When building with jupyter-book, I needed the following extra packages installed

````
sudo apt-get install texlive-xetex
sudo apt-get install texlive-fonts-extra
````
